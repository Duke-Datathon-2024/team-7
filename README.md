## Question
Are there disparities in the length and type of restraint usage in ICU patients based on race?

## Dataset
MIMIC-IV: https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/

## Code
The "SQL" folder includes SQL for retrieving ICU patients with physical restraints, ICU patients with medical restraints, and ICU patients with neither restraints. It's supposed to be run on Google BigQuery.
